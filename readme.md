## Update 1.2

  
  

- Feature 1: **Customizable Trigonometric Functions for the axes** 👀

You can now have the power to customize trigonometric functions for defining angles along the X and Z axes within the Galaxy Generator. Whether it's sin, cos, tan, hyperbolic sin, or other trigonometric functions, you can effortlessly experiment with different functions to create mesmerizing galaxy patterns. 

  

  

- Feature 2: **Dynamic Multipliers** 🫨

Introducing dynamic multipliers for radius, branch, and spin parameters! With a variety of trigonometric functions at their disposal, users can apply multipliers to these parameters, adding a layer of complexity and variability to the galaxy's structure. From sin and cos to hyperbolic tan, the possibilities for creating unique galactic landscapes are endless.


## Update 1.1

  
  

- Feature 1: Screenshots

You can now take a screenshot of the page and save it on your local system in a single 'Click' 🤌

  

  

- Feature 2: Animations

As there was a serious lack of movement in a "Galaxy," I have added some rotation animations. Now you can rotate the Galaxy in whatever axis as you wish 🛐
